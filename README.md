# p5js-spider-game
A simple computer game of logic using p5.js library, js, html and css, albeit a bit nasty. 

Place the 7 spiders in the corners of the eight-pointed star. 

The rules are elementary: you can't send a spider to a place where it's already there, nor can you click on a place where it's already sitting. 
If the situation is hopeless, just restart the game. 

The soundtrack, however, won't miss an opportunity to remind you that you've lost

Good luck!
